## Caution
They are not the best feature for predicting stock value.
Only adjusted close among the all selected features has the direct impact of stock price forecasting here.
It can not be depended on only stock indexs. If it was so easy features to collect data on, then many comapnies will become billioners over night only by simple linear models.

Besides, it's a fascination to forecast stock price from only index values and other stock features.

	Think of Facebook, why it worths so much ! It can not be depended only on stock.
	A comapny's worth value is determined by its promise of growth, power of acquisition,
	how much it create impacts on daily life of people, how much spreaded it is, future events
	and present of the company and many hidden variables.
